## Linux CLI, and HTTP

---

I had practical experience with the console, used basic commands, for example, _"ls"_,_"mkdir"_ and _'cd'_. There were many new things in the course, in particular, _"grep"_, redirection of input and output, which seemed very convenient to me and now I try to use it in practice, setting up the environment. It was difficult with bash scripts, but I won :smile:<br>
On http, in addition to articles, I watched additional materials on YouTube, figured it out.
